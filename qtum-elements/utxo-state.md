UTXO State is a method by which a UTXO is emitted from a smart contract which contains a piece of state. Like a UTXO, it is transferrable between people by destruction and creation. However, when it is sent to a smart contract, reading this state will destroy the state. The state is authenticated with proofs to which smart contract is responsible for its creation.
