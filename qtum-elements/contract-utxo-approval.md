Contract UTXO Approval is a method by which smart contracts within a UTXO can be speculatively executed and the result used to determine if a transaction is valid on the blockchain. This is an opt-in feature, nodes and block creators are free to ignore it for block creation purposes, but not for block validation purposes.
